    "An interesting function that we'll look at several times this semester is $y=\\sin(x^2)$. One of the most interesting features of this function is that while it is continuous for all real numbers, it does not have an \"elementary\" antiderivative: it has an antiderivative family, but it cannot be written down with our basic function types.\n",

    "For this leading example, we'll investigate the area between $f(x) = \\sin(x^2)$ and $g(x) = 2x$ on the interval $[0,2]$. Since $2x>\\sin(x^2)$ on this interval, the integral expression that we would use is:\n",

    "Let's plot the two functions, to get a good visualization of the area we're considering. We'll plot $f(x) = \\sin(x^2)$ and $g(x) = 2x$ on the interval $[0,2]$.\n",

    "## Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the following code to plot the two functions $f$ and $f$ on the interval $[0,2]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I'll define $n=20$, and so $\\Delta x=0.1$ for now, using the code `n = 20` and `delt_x = 2/n`. Then, using the `np.arange()` function, I've defined an interval of $x$-values from $0$ to $2$, counting up by $\\Delta x$. Note that the `np.arange()` function does not \"end\" the interval at the second value -- instead, it counts as close as it can get without including or going past. That's why I've defined it to \"end\" at $2+\\Delta x$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the code `np.arange(0,2, delt_x)` gives a list of values that looks like $\\{0,  0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1,  1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7,1.8, 1.9\\}$. This is great for my Riemann sum! I'll use those kinds of values as my `xPartition`, since that will give me the *left-most* $x$-values from each subinterval/rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my graph, though, I'd like to plot this all the way up to *and including* 2. So the way to get around that is to use `np.arange(0,2+delt_x, delt_x)`. You'll notice I use `xVals = np.arange(0,2+delt_x, delt_x)` for graphing, while I use `xPartition = np.arange(0,2, delt_x)` for the Riemann sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, I define the functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. Note that the double asterisk, `**`, represents an exponent, so `x**2` is $x^2$. Also note that I need to call the sine function from the `numpy` library. We'll use this `np.` prefix for our trig functions, square roots, and even pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, I plot the functions (using the $x$-values I defined earlier), add a title to the graph, and display the graph using the last four lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `plt.plot(x,y)` takes in some list of $x$-values and corresponding $y$-values, and then plots those points.\n",
